1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
The audio aura of the listener can be characterized by calculating the average values of energy, valence, and danceability from their top 100 songs. These averages can give us insights into the overall mood and style of music they prefer. For example, high values of energy and danceability might indicate a preference for upbeat and lively music, while high valence could suggest a tendency towards happy and positive songs.

2. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
The current method of calculating the audio aura by averaging the values of energy, valence, and danceability treats all songs equally, regardless of how often they were listened to. This might not be representative of the listener's true preferences. A better approach would be to weight the songs by the number of times they were played, giving more importance to frequently listened songs. Additionally, taking into account other factors such as the time of day the songs were played, or the listener's activities while listening, could provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of their musical preferences.
